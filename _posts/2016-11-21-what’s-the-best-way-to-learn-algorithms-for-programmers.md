Once I was asked this question on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-way-to-learn-algorithms-for-programmers). My answer got 17.7k Views and many upvotes. The person who asked the question needed some specific learning path & resources. When I was used to do competitive programming and learn algorithms, I followed some steps to learn algorithms. Those steps were best fit for me. May be those steps can be helpful for you also. So, here I am sharing my learning steps –

Reading a book is very essential because every topic is described in detail into a book, but in videos/tutorials everything is described in short.

**For books** I will recommend —
1: [Introduction to Algorithms: Charles E. Leiserson, Clifford Stein, Ronald Rivest, and Thomas H. Cormen](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Second-Edition-Thomas/dp/0262032937)
2: [Algorithms (4th Edition): Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Edition-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X)
3: [The Algorithm Design Manual: Steven Skiena](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693)

**Some online resources:**
[Data Science Tutorials](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/)
[Algorithms — GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)

**Resources to practice:**
1: [LightOJ Problems](http://http//lightoj.com/volume_problemcategory.php)
2: [World of Seven — Methods to Solve](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Estevenha/methodstosolve.html)
3: [A2 Online Judge](http://a2oj.com/Categories.jsp)
4: [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains)
5: [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/problemset)

**Now come to the steps:**
I follow **“Learning by doing”** philosophy.

**Step 1:** At first you should learn the theory of any particular algorithm from your books/resources.

**Step 2:** Try to implement the algorithm(theory) you’ve learnt into code without looking at others implementation. After much trying if you can’t implement then take help of others.

**Step 3:** Now pick up a link from **Resources to practice** and solve some problems related to the algorithm you’ve learned recently.

To me this my best way to learn algorithms.

Best of luck.
