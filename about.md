## About
I am Abdullah Al Imran. I have great passion for Computer Science, Technology and more specifically for Computer Programming. The adventurous and beautiful world of computer programming took all of my dedication towards it. That passion for programming drove me to pursue a degree on CSE.

I am currently doing B.Sc in Computer Science & Engineering at American International University-Bangladesh. I am a proud citizen of **Bangladesh** and currently living in **Dhaka**.

Nothing gives me as much pleasure as learning and experimenting new CS stuffs. I always love to learn and dive into new technologies. I do problem solving and love to participate in programming contests. I do quizzing. I love to play Cricket. I love to involve myself into voluntary works.

I built this website to share and note down my little knowledge and experiences through my blog.
